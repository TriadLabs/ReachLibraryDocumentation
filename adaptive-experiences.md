# Reach Adaptive Experiences (Firefly Chase)
The Reach adaptive experiences use the data generated in the Reach assessment experience to generate shorter gameplay sessions that focus on prescribing motion in challenging areas for the user. 

## Adaptive Volume Experience

The volume experience presses users to hit points that are deemed challenging (just on the edge of possible) by the Reach System. Generally a series of 100 points will be prescribed for the user to hit, with 80 being points the Reach system is confident they can hit, and 20 being points that the system is unsure if they will achieve. The experience ends after the user has played for 3 minutes. At the current time gameplay records from adapative experiences do not inform prescription decisions for the rest of the system. Instead the latest assessment data is used when calculating prescribed points here. 

## Adaptive Velocity Experience

The velocity experience times users on their performance as they hit prescribed points. THe user is asked to place their hand at a neutral point designated to them before rushing to hit the prescribed point. THe time taken to hit each point is recorded and the game is counted as complete when the user has played for 3 minutes. At the current time gameplay records from adapative experiences do not inform prescription decisions for the rest of the system. Instead the latest assessment data is used when calculating prescribed points here. 

## Adaptive Accuracy Experience

The accuracy experience challenges users to hit fireflies with a jar that adjusts its size based on the user's performance in the game. As the user hits more consecutive points, the jar's size shrinks (and conversely the jar's size increases as the user misses points). The game is counted as complete when the user has played for 3 minutes. At the current time gameplay records from adapative experiences do not inform prescription decisions for the rest of the system. Instead the latest assessment data is used when calculating prescribed points here.
