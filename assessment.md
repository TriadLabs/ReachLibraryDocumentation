# Reach Assessments

Reach uses an assessment system to create baselines and goals for end-users of the system. When a user first signs up for Reach, one of the first things they will be asked to do is complete an assessment.

## Firefly (Volume) Assessment

[Unity Scene: Main.unity](https://github.com/TriadLabs/Reach-Shoulder-Health-Unity/blob/master/Assets/Scenes/Main.unity)

The Volume Assessment is a fundamental part of the Reach system. When users complete a Volume Assessment, Reach learns about their shoulder limitations and helps set goals for shoulder health progress. The Volume Assessment uses a set of goal target coordinates (fetched via a call to the Reach Middle Tier) that represents the full range of motion for a healthy adult.
