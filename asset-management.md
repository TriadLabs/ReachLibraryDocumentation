# Asset Management for Reach VR Experiences

Reach VR experiences, while originally developed for the Oculus Rift, are transitioning to target Meta Quest devices. As such, all plugins/libraries that are added must be Android-compatible or must provide an Android equivalent with pragma marks as necessary. Development is currently limited by the poly count/tri limits of the Quest 1, so please ensure that scenes are kept under 1M polygons.
