# Asset Management for Reach VR Experiences
The Reach VR experience is transitioning to be availble for Quest. As such all plugins/libraries that are added must be Andriod compatible or provide an Andriod equivalent with pragma marks in the code when needed. We're limited by the poly count/tri limits of the Quest 1 so make sure to keep each scene under 1M polys.
