# The Reach Database

The Reach system includes 1) the Reach Shoulder Health VR application, 2) a web portal where end-users can view their progress, and 3) 3rd party games and experiences that interface with Reach APIs. Each of these three components may access Reach databases.

Currently, Reach uses a staging database for development and testing and a production database for end-users.

To be granted database access, [contact the Reach development team.](mailto:support@triadlabs.com){:target='_blank'}
