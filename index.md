# The Reach Library 

The Reach system uses virtual reality experiences to identify shoulder limitations and recruit movement patterns that enhance shoulder health. The Reach Library enables partners to develop applications that can send and receive movement data that has been generated by Reach.

The Reach system includes 1) the Reach Shoulder Health VR application, 2) a web portal where end-users can view their progress, and 3) 3rd party games and experiences that interface with Reach APIs. Each of these three components may access Reach databases and API endpoints.
