# Reach Library Documentation

The Reach Library is a downloadable Unity package that allows you to call and interact with the Reach system and API. You can use it to do a variety of tasks within the Reach ecosystem such as send information about a user's motion data and game performance as well as to get back coordinates which can drive gameplay elements.
