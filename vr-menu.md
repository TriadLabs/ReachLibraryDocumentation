# The Reach VR Experience Main Menu

**Left Panel**

This menu allows the user to change settings that affect the Reach experience. There are certain settings on it that only appear to Reach "superusers" such as the ability to record data as someone else and choose what types of points are prescribed in Reach experiences.

**Middle Menu**

This menu stores the menu options for all Reach Experiences. Current experiences are the Reach Assessment, Reach Assessment (Volume Defined), Firefly Chase (volume, velocity, and accuracy), Space Gunner, and Power Solitare. 

**Menu Compeonents**
The menu has many built in components to help with ease of building. On the left hand panel you'll find elements such as checkboxes, buttons, and sliders that are pre-built and can be duplicated and re-used. On the middle menu you'll find that every menu item is once again a component that can be re-used. Look at MainMenuManager.cs for more information. 

**Right Menu**

This menu displays the instructions neccesary to access the Reach Portal. If a user has not signed up for the portal then it will display signup instructions as well as the code neccesary to link their VR data with our portal.
